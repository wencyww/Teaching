I found it difficult to jump right into a complex problem, and I wasn't sure at first what it was asking for. I noticed towards the end there were simpler, fill in the blank problems. One suggestion for next time may be to put the simpler questions first, just to help students ease into the exam, especially for those with test anxiety. This isn't a huge necessity, as students are always free to go through the exam and start with simpler ones, but this is just an idea :)",0.0,One suggestion is going over some of the more complex in-class problems a little more slowly.
